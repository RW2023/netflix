    "##   Titles released trend over a period ranging approximately from 1995 to 2023 is interesting. Here's my analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Observation**: There's a noticeable increase in the number of titles released over time, with a particularly sharp upturn around 2020. This could be due to various factors such as Netflix’s expansion into original content production, increased investment in acquiring titles, or a strategic decision to broaden their library to attract a larger subscriber base. Covid could have something to do with the timing as well.\n",
    "- **Early Years**: From 1995 until around 2010, the number of titles released each year appears relatively stable and low. This period likely corresponds with Netflix's early years when it was primarily a DVD rental service with a more limited streaming catalog.\n",
    "- **Growth Phase**: Starting around 2010, there is a gradual increase in releases, which aligns with the period when Netflix began focusing more on streaming and expanding its digital content library. The trend continues to rise steadily, reflecting the company's growing emphasis on providing a wide variety of streaming content.\n",
    "- **Sharp Increase**: Around 2020, there's a dramatic spike in the number of titles. This could be related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a surge in streaming services as people spent more time at home. It might also reflect a strategic push by Netflix to release more content to capture the increased demand for home entertainment.\n",
    "- **Data Anomalies**: The sharp drop immediately following the spike suggests a potential anomaly in data collection or a change in strategy, possibly as the world started moving past the peak of the pandemic. It could also be due to incomplete data for the year 2023 if the dataset does not cover the whole year.\n",
    "- **Overall Trend**: The overall trend indicates an aggressive content growth strategy by Netflix, which is likely a combination of increasing original content production and licensing more third-party content to keep subscribers engaged and attract new ones."

    "- The maturity rating **\"U/A 7+\"** has the highest number of titles, indicating that a significant portion of the content on Netflix is suitable for viewers aged 7 and above with parental guidance.\n",
    "- The **\"U/A 13+\"** category follows closely, suggesting that there is also a substantial amount of content deemed appropriate for teenagers with parental guidance.\n",
    "- The **\"U/A 16+\"** category has a lower count in comparison, showing that there are fewer titles targeted towards older teenagers.\n",
    "- The **\"A\"** rating, which stands for Adult content, has even fewer titles, implying that content strictly for adults is less prevalent on the platform.\n",
    "- Finally, the **\"U\"** category, which usually denotes content suitable for all ages, has the least number of titles according to this dataset. This is somewhat surprising as one might expect a platform like Netflix to have a large number of universal titles.\n",

    "This likely reflects an overall content strategy of Netflix, aiming to cater to a broad audience with a focus on content that is suitable for a young audience but still requires parental guidance. It may also reflect regulatory requirements or cultural content preferences in the region from which this data was collected."

    "### Context and Rationale for the `duration_to_minutes` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our initial objective was to analyze various aspects of a Netflix dataset, including the duration of movies and shows. We aimed to understand trends, correlations, and other insights related to the length of these titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Encountered**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The duration data in the dataset was presented in a string format, like '2h 9m', combining hours and minutes. This format posed a challenge for quantitative analysis because we couldn't directly perform calculations (like averaging or correlating) on these string values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale for the Chosen Method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To overcome this challenge, we needed to convert these string values into a purely numerical format. The most logical and straightforward representation was to convert the entire duration into minutes. This conversion would allow us to utilize the duration data in various statistical and numerical analyses, making the data more versatile and useful for our objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the `duration_to_minutes` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `duration_to_minutes` function was specifically created to convert the duration of movies/shows from the string format ('2h 9m') to a numeric format (total minutes). This conversion was essential to enable us to perform quantitative analyses on the duration data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checking for Hours and Minutes**:\n",
    "   - The function first checks if the duration string contains both hours ('h') and minutes ('m'). If it does, it splits the string at 'h', separates the hours and minutes, and converts them to integers. The total duration in minutes is calculated by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes.\n",
    "2. **Handling Only Hours or Minutes**:\n",
    "   - If the duration string contains only hours or only minutes, the function handles these cases separately by stripping the respective identifiers ('h' or 'm') and converting the remaining number to an integer. The total duration is then calculated appropriately (either by converting hours to minutes or directly using the minutes).\n",
    "3. **Edge Case Handling**:\n",
    "   - In cases where the duration string does not follow the expected format, the function returns 0. This ensures that our dataset remains clean and consistent for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function is applied to each row in the duration column of our DataFrame, transforming each duration entry into a numeric value. This newly computed numerical data is stored in a new column named 'duration_minutes'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With this transformation, we now have a DataFrame that includes the duration of each title in minutes, allowing us to conduct various statistical analyses and gain deeper insights into the dataset."
