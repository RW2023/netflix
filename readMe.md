# Netflix Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a Netflix dataset to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in the content available on the platform. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as release trends, genre distributions, durations, maturity ratings, and moods of the titles. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of Netflix's content strategy, viewer preferences, and the evolution of its library over time.

## Key Features

- **Release Year Trends**: Analysis of how the number of titles released by Netflix has varied over the years.
- **Genre Analysis**: Exploration of the most common genres and their trends.
- **Duration Analysis**: Conversion of title durations from string format to numerical for quantitative analysis.
- **Maturity Rating Analysis**: Investigation of the distribution of content across different maturity ratings and its correlation with other factors.
- **Mood Analysis**: Examination of the emotional tone or atmosphere prevalent in Netflix's content.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing and development environment.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes for each title available on Netflix, such as name, release year, maturity rating, duration, description, genre, mood, cast, subtitles, and audio options.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks included in the repository to view the analysis.

## Results and Insights

I will add insights here as they reveal themselves:

Summary of Insights so far: 

- Trends Over Time: There is a slight tendency for newer titles to be longer and have slightly higher maturity ratings, though these trends are not strong.
- Content Complexity and Duration: There is a more noticeable trend where content aimed at older audiences is longer, possibly due to the complexity and depth of such content.
